Once logged in, you can choose from numerous gallery templates specifically designed for showcasing photographs. Selecting a template that aligns with your vision is the first step. </p><h3>Customizing Your Wix Template</h3><p>After selecting a template, you can start customizing it to give it your personal touch.

Popular choices include Astra, OceanWP, and the Photo Me theme. After installing the theme, you can add essential plugins to enhance your website's functionality: galleries (Envira Gallery), slideshows, SEO tools (Yoast SEO), and more.</p><h3>Setting Up a WordPress Travel Gallery</h3><p>Creating beautiful galleries in WordPress may involve using plugins such as Envira Gallery or NextGEN Gallery.
