  "mainContentHtml": "<h2>Setting Up Your Squarespace Wedding Gallery</h2><p>First, ensure you have a Squarespace account. If you don’t have one yet, you can <a href=\"https://www.squarespace.com/\">sign up here</a>. Select a template that complements your wedding theme—anything from minimalist to ornate can be found in Squarespace's vast library.</p><p>Once you’ve decided on a template, navigate to the main dashboard where you’ll be able to create a new page specifically for your wedding gallery. You can do this by clicking on 'Pages', then '+', and selecting 'Gallery'. Ensure the page is aptly named, like 'Wedding Memories' or 'Our Special Day'.</p><h3>Uploading Images to Your Wedding Gallery</h3><p>With your gallery page created, it’s time to upload your stunning wedding photos. Click on your newly created gallery page. You’ll find an 'Add Image' option where you can directly drag and drop images from your computer or upload them using the file browser.</p><p><ul><li>Drag and Drop: Simply drag your image files from your local drive into the Squarespace interface.</li><li>Upload Button: Use this method if you prefer browsing your directories. Click 'Add Image', then select your files.</li></ul></p><p>Squarespace allows you to upload multiple images at once, but be mindful of your image sizes and quality (we’ll cover this in the technical tips section).</p><h3>Technical Tips for Image Uploads</h3><p><ul><li><strong>File Size and Format:</strong> For web optimal display, use JPEG or PNG formats. Keep file sizes below 1MB to ensure fast page loading without compromising on visual quality.</li><li><strong>Image Dimensions:</strong> Recommended minimum width is 1500 pixels for large displays such as hero images, but for galleries, 1000 pixels should suffice.</li><li><strong>Resolution:</strong> A resolution of 72 DPI is generally sufficient for web, allowing for quick loading while maintaining clarity.</li><li><strong>File Naming:</strong> Use descriptive file names to aid SEO and make them easier to manage behind the scenes (e.g., \"first_dance_wedding.jpg\").</li></ul></p><h3>Creating a Successful Wedding Gallery</h3><p><ul><li><strong>Curate Thoughtfully:</strong> Choose images that tell a story—from preparation to the last dance. A mix of candid moments and planned portraits works well.</li><li><strong>Consistent Styling:</strong> Keep color grading and filters uniform across photos for cohesive presentation.</li><li><strong>Captions and Stories:</strong> Add captions or short stories for each photo to engage viewers more deeply.</li><li><strong>Organize Intuitively:</strong> Consider chronological order or themed sections to make navigation intuitive.</li><li><strong>Test Responsiveness:</strong> Ensure your gallery looks great across devices—smartphones, tablets, desktops.</li></ul></p><p>While designing, keep the user experience in mind. Simplicity often yields the best engagement.</p>",
