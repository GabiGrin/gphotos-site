  "mainContentHtml": "<h2>Setting Up a Squarespace Account</h2><p>To get started, visit the Squarespace website and create an account. If you're new, you can benefit from a free trial to explore the platform's features before committing to a subscription plan. Existing users can simply log in and proceed to create a new website.</p><h2>Choosing the Right Template</h2><p>Your choice of template lays the foundation for your travel gallery. Squarespace offers a range of templates, particularly within their 'Photography' and 'Blogging' categories, that are well-suited for travel galleries.

The 'Momentum' or 'Tremont' templates might serve as ideal starting points.</p><h2>Customizing Your Travel Gallery</h2><p>Once your template is selected, it's time to customize it. Navigate to the 'Design' section of Squarespace's editor where you can modify fonts, colors, and styles. Consider using a palette that resonates with the theme of your travels—earth tones for nature escapades or vibrant hues for cityscapes.</p><p><strong>Best Practice:</strong> Maintain consistency in your design elements to create a seamless experience for visitors.</p><h2>Adding and Organizing Photos</h2><p>Head over to the 'Pages' section and create a new gallery page.
